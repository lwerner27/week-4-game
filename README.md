# Pokemon RPG Game

This is pokemon RPG game based on some of the elements of the actual game.

All the pokemon have a base attack base counter attack and base health.

You must use the type advantages and weaknesses to defeat the computer (the other three pokemon you did not choose).

For the simplification of this game pokemon do not have sub types and they have only one weakness.

For the purposes of this game water will not be weak to Electric type pokemon.

Weaknesses work as as follows:
    + Fire is weak to Water
    + Water is weak to Grass 
    + Grass is Weak to Fire.

Pikachu has no weakness or resistance that pertain to the other 3 pokemon.

Pikachu has a higher Attack Increase factor to account for this.
